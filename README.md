I first used to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to build the new design and used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to help me keep track of progress and [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) for documentation and note taking. Please feel free to check out some more design work on my [dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/AlexisQuintuna).
